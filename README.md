# RL_racetrack

A python implementation of reinforcement learning applied to a simple racetrack simulation.

Created for the Introduction to Machine Learning graduate course in computer science 
through Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering.
Application idea, 'racetrack' file, and high-level algorithms pseudocode 
were provided as part of the course.
All other content including code, the paper, and video are my own.
